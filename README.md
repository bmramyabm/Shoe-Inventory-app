# README Template

In this project, students will apply their skills in building layouts and navigation files by building a Shoe Store app. They will build an app with four screens:

Login
Onboarding
Shoe listing
Shoe detail page
While the login and onboarding pages will not do anything, the user will need to save the login state so that the login and onboarding pages do not show again.

The shoe listing page will show the list of shoes and show a button for adding a new shoe, while the detail page will be for adding a shoe entry. All entries will be saved only as long as the app is running.
